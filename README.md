# Repository structure
## Instruction for running your code
My data local is different to you, the csv name is train, test and gender_submission. 
My local is C:/Users/siusa/Downloads/MXN442-N11423579-Siu-Wing-Hei/
In while markdown I need to load each csv 2 time. 1 time of article method, 1 time of new method.
So you need to change the local to your local total 6 time. If not the code can not run.
You can use ctrl + f to find C:/Users/siusa/Downloads/MXN442-N11423579-Siu-Wing-Hei/

train <- read.csv("C:/Users/siusa/Downloads/MXN442-N11423579-Siu-Wing-Hei/train.csv")
test <- read.csv("C:/Users/siusa/Downloads/MXN442-N11423579-Siu-Wing-Hei/test.csv")
gender_submission <- read.csv("C:/Users/siusa/Downloads/MXN442-N11423579-Siu-Wing-Hei/gender_submission.csv")
